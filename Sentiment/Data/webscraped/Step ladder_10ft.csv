I have uploaded the pictures of the received product. please see and decide if you are busy through daraz or not. The product itself is average quality. but the shipping service keeps getting late so I have to call them several times to get the item delivered. customer service from the seller is like okay sir yes sir thank you sir. I mean is it professional ? when the buyer asks about their item its the answer you got ? And the item received with damages on it. I don't know how it was damaged. but when I unwrap the packaging the cut was there in one leg of the ladder. shipping service is late.and they are in a hurry. don't know but can't recommend certis Lanka now sitrek or something to anyone. if you're not a bargain hunter like me please do purchase. directly from dealer.overall shopping experience is not good. Really sorry about that.,4
"greate value for the price the built quality is reasonable, NOT super sturdy the shipping from daraz is very slow, took longer time to receive, need to improve shipping time for larger goods from daraz",4
"Grate Quality ladder, Very stady and light weight",5

This time the local delivery time was too long. Even though the ladder reached Jaffna on Friday the 8th the transportation within took another 8 days. The communication of the delivery agent was very poor. I wasted two whole days waiting for delivery. The quality of the ladder is good. Seller response was satisfied ,5
