The ladder was delivered carefully and fast. Product is good. Only negative comment is seller should have cleaned the top of the ladder before shipping as it‚Äôs dirty and not what one expects when purchasing a unused/new item. #WIN,4
Handy item to be used in kitchen and rooms to take thing's in tall cupboards. essay to carry. but there are sharp edges were could be minor injuries. I did not expect this from a reputed manufacturer. they should take serious not to improve the final touches on their products.,4
