Carefully Delivered within 5 days. Total 8ft is wrapped with bubble wrapping to ensure safety delivery. You can see it in the image. Good quality product. Happy with the purchase. Thank you Swissteck Aluminum & Daraz. Cheers !!!,5
"Love it. Rigid and lightweight, have no second thought about swisstek ladders. Delivery was fast aswell - which is was within 2 days. Seller processed and handed the item over to daraz within hours after I placed the order and made sure it was before the second half of the day making it eligible for next day delivery. Overall great experience with swisstek, wish the company the best of business.",5

Good quality ladder to do the works..,5
දින 9 විතර ගියා ලැබෙන්න. ඒත් බඩු හොඳයි. අනික් ලැඩර් වලට වඩා බරයි. ශක්තිමත්. ඩිලිවරි සර්විස් එකත් හොඳයි. කලබල නැතුව හොඳින් කතාකලා. බොහොම ස්තුතියි,5
"Good product. Seller was quick to rectify a delivery mistake. However, Daraz and the Deliver Partner was horrible. Didn't deliver the product and sent a mail saying it was delivered. When they came with the actual delivery the delivery guy was rude. Unhappy with Daraz and delivery partner, but seller was good.",5
"The ladder is sturdy, lightweight, and perfect for reaching high places around the house. It’s exactly what I needed and great value for the price. Highly recommend! Thank you to the delivery team for the fast and secure delivery.",5
"The ladder was received as described in the order. However, it does not appear to have undergone any quality control checks. There are numerous sharp edges present at all the joints. While the ladder seems sufficiently stable and strong for a person of average build, the overall quality is concerning.",4

"The delivery company is awful and manipulative. They claimed to have called me a few days ago but could not show me call records. I never had any calls from them, but they marked the Daraz system as they tried many times. When I asked the delivery guy he didn't have a reply. Please refrain from using this bad delivery partner, at least for my orders",4

"Highly Recommend product, Vendor and Delivery service ",5
"Product is good and just as expected. Delivery dates were given as between 4th to 8th October, but it was delivered on 30th September. However the professionalism of the courier company should improve. They should first contact the customer and check if the customer is available at a given time before delivering the product. During all my previous deliveries the couriers suddenly showed up without any notice. Once for a COD order I didn’t have cash in hand as the product delivery date given was a few days after the day It arrived. I had to borrow from the a third party. I think this should definitely be addressed",5
